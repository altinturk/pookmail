# pookmail

PookMail.com was a disposable email accounts System developed in the middle of 2004.

Our main goal was to give a place where people could receive emails without any kind of register nor signup. Usually people used PookMail to receive their confirmation emails.

But unfortunately in the middle of 2008 we had to close PookMail.com.

We think the best tribute we can pay to PookMail.com is to release its source code to the Community.

So, if you want to have your own Disponsable Email Account System, go on! Download and install it!
